(struct line (strings length) #:transparent #:mutable)
; A line is a list of elements of the types:
;   strings       represents actual text
;   property      represents a text property e.g. bold
;   overlay       represents ...

; properties are copied as part of the text
; overlays are not copied - they are specifically not part of the text
(struct overlay  (specification) #:transparent)
(struct property (specification) #:transparent)

(struct linked-line dcons (version marks) #:transparent #:mutable)
; the element of a linked-line is a line struct
; marks is a set of marks located on the line
; version will be used for the redisplay code

(struct text (lines positions length) #:transparent #:mutable)
; A text being edited is represented as a doubly linked list of lines.
;    lines     is a linked-line
;    positions is an interval-map (from position to linked-line)
;    length    is the number of characters (including newlines) in the text

(struct stats (num-lines num-chars) #:transparent)
; The number of lines and number of characters in a text.

(require (submod "." buffer-struct))
; A buffer is the basic unit of text being edited.
; It contains a text being edited.
; The buffer has a name, so the user can refer to the buffer.
; The buffer might have an associated file:
;   path = #f     <=>  buffer is not associated with a file
;   path = path   <=>  reads and writes to the file given by the path
; A point is a position between two characters. 
; Insertions and deletion will happen at the points (usually only one).
; If modified? is true, then the buffer has been modified since the last
; read or save of the file.
; The list modes contains the active modes (see below).
; A buffer can have multiple marks:
; marks = list of marks

(struct mark (buffer link position name fixed? active?) #:transparent #:mutable)
; A mark rembers a position in the text of a buffer.
; The mark stores the link (linked-line) which hold the line.
; The mark name can be used to refer to the mark.
;   fixed? = #f  A normal mark moves when insertions are made to the buffer.
;   fixed? = #t  A fixed-mark remain in place.
;   active? =#t  text between mark and point is an active region 
;   active? =#f  region is non-active (will not be highlighted)

; If there is exactly one mark, the area between the point and the mark
; is called a region.

(struct mode (name) #:transparent)
; A mode has a name (displayed in the status bar).

(struct window (frame panel borders canvas parent buffer start-mark end-mark) #:mutable #:transparent)
; A window is an area in which a buffer is displayed.
; Multiple windows are grouped in a frame.
; Split windows are backed by a panel.
; Single windows are backed by a canvas into which the buffer is rendered.
; borders is a set of symbols indicating which borders to draw
;   'left 'right 'top 'bottom
; start = mark of first position in buffer to display
; end   = mark of last posistion in buffer to display
; The marks start and end are updated on redisplay such that
; the point is visible.

; status-line = status-line% at bottom of frame%

; A frame contains one or multiple windows.
