;;; STATUS LINE
;;;

; Each frame (GUI window) has a status line - a horizontal line at
; the bottom of the frame (under the displayed buffer). The status
; line is used to display information on the current buffer.

; The default information displayed is:
;   - name of the current buffer
;   - the row and column of the point 
;   - the position of the point
;   - the current major mode
;   - the time used to run the last commands (measured in milliseconds)
